# Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a binding protein that transports sex hormones (primarily testosterone and estrogen). By binding to these hormones SHBG protects them from being degraded, however reduces their bioavailability. SHBG levels increase naturally as we age, as well as raise with estrogen (including synthetic estrogens such as contraceptives), whereas insulin has a suppressive effect on SHBG levels.

### Optimal values

50-80nmol/L (female)
40-50nmol/L (male)

### Low SHBG

- PCOS
- Metabolic dysfunction
- Higher bioavailable testosterone
- Hypothyroidism

### High SHBG

- Low bioavailable testosterone
- Ageing
- High estrogen / synthetic estrogens (e.g. contraceptives)
- Disordered eating
- Hyperthyroidism

### What next?

→ **If SHBG is low**, assess metabolic markers (e.g. HBA1C, Glucose, Insulin) and thyroid markers (e.g. TSH, FT3, FT4)

→ **If SHBG is high**, assess estrogen or contraceptive use and thyroid markers (e.g. TSH, FT3, FT4)
