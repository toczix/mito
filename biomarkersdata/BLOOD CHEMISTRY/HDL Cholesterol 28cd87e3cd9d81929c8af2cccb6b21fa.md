# HDL Cholesterol

HDL Cholesterol is generally (and incorrectly) considered the 'good' cholesterol because it acts as a cholesterol transporter away from peripheral tissue towards the liver. HDL Cholesterol can be both protective (acting as an antioxidant) and can also increase cardiovascular disease risk (by acting as a pro oxidant), and assessing HDL Cholesterol in bloodwork does not indicate whether it is acting as an antioxidant or pro oxidant.

### Optimal values

1.29-2.2mmol/L or 50-85mg/dL
*Note: HDL Cholesterol on the higher end of this range seems to be more protective in females than in males.*

### Low HDL Cholesterol

- Cholestasis (low bile flow)
- Insulin resistance / obesity
- Hyperthyroidism
- Anabolic steroid use

### High HDL Cholesterol

- Negative gram bacteria overgrowth (high LPS)
- Intestinal permeability
- Liver dysfunction
- Excessive alcohol intake
- Inflammation / autoimmunity
