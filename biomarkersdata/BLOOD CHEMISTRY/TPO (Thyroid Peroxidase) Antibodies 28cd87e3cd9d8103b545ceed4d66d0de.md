# TPO (Thyroid Peroxidase) Antibodies

TPO is an enzyme found within the thyroid that is required to form the thyroid hormone T4. An elevation in TPO antibodies suggests that the individual is having an immune response and attacking the TPO enzymes within the thyroid cells. An elevation in TPO antibodies is present in over 90% of people with autoimmune hypothyroidism and 70% of people with autoimmune hyperthyroidism, however around 15% of people with elevated TPO antibodies have normal thyroid function.

### Optimal values

Different labs measure TPO antibodies differently, therefore refer to the lab specific reference range.

### Low TPO Antibodies

- No clinical significance (a low test result is desirable)

### High TPO Antibodies

- Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (autoimmune hypothyroidism)
- Grave's disease
- Associated with other autoimmune conditions such as Celiac disease and Autoimmune Gastritis
- Associated with spontaneous miscarriage and recurrent miscarriage

### What next?

→ Assess full thyroid panel (including [TSH](TSH%20(Thyroid%20Stimulating%20Hormone)%2028cd87e3cd9d8100be26f8bbe331cf27.md), FT4, and FT3). In some cases thyroid replacement may be required.
