# Total Protein

Total Protein is the sum total of **Albumin** and **Globulin**. If a lab does not report both the Albumin and Globulin scores, these can be calculated by subtracting one from Total Protein (e.g. subtracting Albumin from Total Protein will give you the Globulin score). 

<aside>
💡 ***Because Total Protein does not specify which protein marker is low (Albumin or Globulin), this marker is of little clinical relevance and you should always refer to Albumin and Globulin.***

### Optimal values

62-78g/L or 6.2-7.8g/dL

### High or Low Total Protein

Whether Total Protein is High, Low, or Normal, we must always assess Albumin and Globulin levels. Traditionally people claim that low Total Protein can be a sign of malnourishment, under the 'Albumin' and 'Globulin' sections I talk about this more, however I personally wouldn't use Total Protein as a strong indicator of malnourishment.
