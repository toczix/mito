# Phosphorus

A large amount of phosphorus is stored in bone, however it is also a primary component of the phospholipid membrane of all cells in the body. Phosphorus is essential for energy production. Phosphorus (like calcium) is largely regulated by the kidneys.

### Optimal values

3.0-4.0mg/dl OR 0.97-1.29mmol/l

### Low Phosphorus

- Poor absorption (e.g. low stomach acid)
- Low vitamin D
- High insulin / refined carbohydrate intake

### High Phosphorus

- Excess vitamin D
- Kidney insufficiency
- Parathyroid hypofunction
- Bone growth (e.g. in children)
- Excess processed foods

### What next?

**→ If phosphorus is high or low**, assess for factors that could influence absorption (e.g. Vitamin D levels, Parathyroid Hormone, dietary intake of phosphorus or refined sugar).
