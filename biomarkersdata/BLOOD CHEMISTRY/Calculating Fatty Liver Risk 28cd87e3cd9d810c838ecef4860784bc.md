# Calculating Fatty Liver Risk

Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects about 1 in 4 adults, yet most cases are undiagnosed. Diagnosis is traditionally done via ultrasounds, MRIs, and CT scans, and accuracy of these tests are around 70-80% ([1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34511367/)). However, we can calculate someone's fatty liver risk almost as accurately as an ultrasound (around 67% accuracy for predicting positive cases) using a simple blood test and measuring tape ([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8123596/)).

### The Fatty Liver Index

The fatty liver index is a tool supported in the literature for determining someone's fatty liver risk. In the above meta analysis, those with a fatty liver index score of >60 had a 67% prevalence of fatty liver (whereas a score below 30 had a prevalence of only 14%). To calculate the fatty liver index, all you need GGT, Triglycerides, Waist Circumference, and BMI. Here is a calculator that does all the hard work for you:
