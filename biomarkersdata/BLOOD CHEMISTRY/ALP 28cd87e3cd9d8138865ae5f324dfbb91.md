# ALP

ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) is a liver enzyme found predominantly in the liver / biliary tree, bones and teeth, placenta, small intestines, and kidneys. Alkaline Phosphatase is an enzyme that removes phosphate from phosphate esters and is zinc dependant (therefore low levels are associated with zinc dependency). Dysfunction or damage within the biliary tree / liver, bone, or significant intestinal damage are associated with increased levels.

### Optimal values

65-100IU/L

### Low ALP

- Low Zinc
- Vitamin C and Magnesium have also been associated with low ALP

### High ALP

- Biliary dysfunction
- Liver damage
- Bone damage / bone growth (e.g children)
- IBD condition
- Pregnancy

### What next?

<aside>
💡 → Assess against other liver enzymes.

→ If ***ALP is low*** + GGT is low **consider magnesium deficiency** (can also test serum magnesium levels).

→ If ***ALP is elevated*** 'ALP Isoenzymes' can be tested to identify which tissue the increase is coming from.
→ If ***ALP is elevated*** + GGT is elevated + Bilirubin is elevated **consider biliary dysfunction**.

### Update (August 18th)

Today I want to mention one more association I've been researching: a link to low B12.

- A very old case study from 1964 found that a child with severe B12 deficiency had very low ALP levels. Upon repletion with B12 the ALP levels rose. The suspected mechanism was that the B12 was limiting osteoblasts (bone growth) and therefore reducing ALP levels (1). Old rat studies however found that B12 supplementation had no affect on ALP status in diabetic or normal rats (2), so is there really a link?
- A study in 1988 assessed 12 people who were deficient in B12, and 10 people who were not. What they found was really interesting; the amount of liver ALP was about the same in the two groups, but the amount of bone ALP was significantly lower in the B12 deficient group. They found that in 11 of the 12 deficient participants, ALP levels rose with B12 supplementation, however ALP levels were unchanged in the non deficient group when they supplemented with B12 (3).
- While not as compelling, an in vitro study also found that B12 has a stimulatory affect on ALP in human bone marrow cells (4).

**Bottom line:** 

While this has not been thoroughly studied, the few studies we have show support that in cases of extreme B12 deficiency, we may see a low serum Alkaline Phosphatase levels that improve with B12 repletion.
