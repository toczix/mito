# SIBO Testing - this can make it more accurate

There are two primary SIBO tests commonly used - lactulose breath testing and glucose breath testing. I have previously discussed how lactulose breath testing (which is more common) is incredibly inaccurate, and some researchers believe it shot not be used at all even the literature that used it should be discounted (1). When we compare lactulose to glucose breath testing, we see that glucose breath testing is significantly more accurate (however still has very poor accuracy overall) (2).

While I personally don't use breath testing with my own clients, I know many practitioners do, and many people who experience digestive symptoms choose to undergo this test. For those that do choose to do a glucose breath test, **here is something that can improve the accuracy:**

When participants modify their diet the day before a glucose breath test, the results significantly differ. By cutting out fibre-based foods and FODMAPs the day prior, and doing an antiseptic mouth rinse the day prior (to limit the impact of oral microbiome), baseline methane and hydrogen levels are significantly reduced (3). This reduces the impact of food and oral microbiome on test results and enhances accuracy. 

### Bottom Line

While I don't personally use glucose breath tests for SIBO, if undergoing this test, following a strict diet the day prior to the test (e.g. rice, animal protein, and hard cheese) as well as performing an antiseptic mouth rinse is advisable to enhance testing accuracy.
