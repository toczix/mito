# Blood Tests and Thyroid Medication

***When should you take thyroid medication around a blood test?*** 

Let's cover a few examples:

- T4 only medication: For those taking T4 only, TSH and FT3 levels should remain consistent, however FT4 levels will elevate for a few hours. Therefore T4 only medication could cause falsely elevated FT4 levels, and is best taken after the blood test.
- T3 only OR T3 + T4 combination medication: For those taking T3, the opposite occurs, FT4 levels stay consistent but FT3 levels significantly elevate for a few hours. Once again, delaying T3 medication until after the blood test is best.
- Finally, what if someone has forgotten to take their thyroid medication for a few days? Within 72 hours there is a significant increase in TSH levels, and a greater increase occurs between 3-6 days without medication (2). During this time the FT3:FT4 ratio also increases (signifying a larger drop in FT4 levels).

### Botton line

Delaying thyroid medication for the morning until after a blood test is taken will provide the most reliable thyroid results, and testing levels 72 hours after the last thyroid medication dose was taken will provide falsely increased TSH levels and FT3:FT4 ratios.
