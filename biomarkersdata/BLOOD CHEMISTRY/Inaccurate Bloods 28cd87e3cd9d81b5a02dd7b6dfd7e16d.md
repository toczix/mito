# Inaccurate Bloods

Last week's post on how to spot inaccurate bloods generated a lot of interest. I got some feedback that having patterns to look for would be helpful, so below I'm providing some additional specific patterns we can apply to identify if we've got some inaccurate blood test results. There may be additional markers impacted by the below situations, but these are some easy to spot trends:

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Dehydration

- Elevated BUN/Urea, Albumin, and Hemoglobin
- Sodium and Potassium may be elevated

---

### Not fasted

- Elevated BUN/Urea, AST, ALP, ALT, and Triglycerides
- Serum Iron will be elevated for up to 5 hours after an iron containing meal
- Glucose may be high or low
- Bilirubin may be low

---

### **Excessive fasting - longer than 12 hours**

- Elevated Transferrin Saturation and Serum Iron
- Bilirubin may be elevated

---

### Exercise too close to blood test (e.g. within 48 hours)

- Elevated AST, ALT, LDH, Creatine Kinase

---

### Lab error - hemolysis

- Elevated Potassium and LDH

---

### Recent alcohol intake

- Elevated GGT and Transferrin Saturation

---

### Biotin supplementation

- Elevated FT4 and FT3
- Decreased TSH
