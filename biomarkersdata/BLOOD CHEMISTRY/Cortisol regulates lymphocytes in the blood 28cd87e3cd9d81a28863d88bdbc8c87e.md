# Cortisol regulates lymphocytes in the blood

[Lymphocytes](Lymphocytes%2028cd87e3cd9d8149be72e936ec49d815.md) are a group of white blood cells that respond to foreign microbes, infections, and inflammation. These are one marker that may correlate to more serious infections when they are significantly elevated (or even suppressed). As always, freaking out over one blood test isn't the right approach, but digging deeper with further testing may be warranted. One common (and less sinister) cause of an irregular lymphocyte result however, is dysregulation in cortisol.

- There are different types of lymphocytes, and studies have shown that particular types of lymphocytes in the blood (as opposed to in the tissue) are especially susceptible to the effects of cortisol (1,2)
- In people with medically high cortisol (Cushing syndrome), the excess cortisol caused a suppression of lymphocytes and an increased risk of infections (3), while those with low cortisol had higher levels of lymphocytes that lowered once exogenous cortisol was administered (4)
- This is apparent not just in pathological states but in healthy people through daily stressors. Studies have found that students undergoing an exam period, or people participating in a new intense training regime also experienced changes in lymphocyte levels (5,6)

### Bottom line

When I see abnormally high or low lymphocytes in blood test results, I recommend clients discuss these results with their doctors to investigate further. However, assessing for acute or chronic stressors, or assessing for bloodwork indications of a dysregulated cortisol / stress response may provide potential clues to the irregular results.
