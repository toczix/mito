# Serum Folate

Folate is a B Vitamin (B9) that is required (along with B12) for DNA synthesis, red blood synthesis, homocysteine metabolism, methylation, and maternal health. Serum folate is a sensitive marker of short-term folate intake, responding very quickly to dietary changes or supplementation. As such, low serum folate is a good indicator of dietary adequacy, however may not always reflect a chronic deficiency.

### Optimal values

34.09nmol/L - 59nmol/L
15ng/ml - 25.96ng/ml

### Low Serum Folate

- Low dietary folate intake
- Megaloblastic anemia
- Neural tube defect
- Medication use (e.g. Metformin, oral contraception)

### High Serum Folate

- Excess supplementation
- Maternal risks
- May be associated with bacterial overgrowth

### What next?

**→ If Serum Folate is low**, assess for low B12, high Homocysteine, and high MCV to indicate suspected B Vitamin deficiencies.

**→ If Serum Folate is high**, assess for excess supplementation.
