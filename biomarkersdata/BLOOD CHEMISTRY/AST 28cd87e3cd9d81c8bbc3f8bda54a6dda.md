# AST

AST (Aspartate Transferase) is know as a liver enzyme and is found in the liver, heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, kidneys, and in small amounts on other tissue. After LDH, AST is the second most abundant enzyme, and has a half life of around 17 hours. ***When AST is elevated it is indicative of cell destruction in one of the areas where it is found.*** 
AST is involved in metabolism and is B6 dependant, so when it is decreased it can be a sign of low B6 status.
