# Expanding on Hemoglobin

Hi everyone! I regularly get requests for more bloodwork content, so I thought I would do a short video on individual markers and discuss a bit more around the nuance of how I interpret it, what kinds of things I consider if its high or low, some common interpretation mistakes, etc.

Blood work interpretation isn't always black and white, and I think learning to identify some nuance and 'grey' area with interpretation is essential.

Hopefully something here is helpful for those of you interested in assessing your own or others' blood work.

Here are more details on [Hemoglobin](Hemoglobin%20(with%20video!)%2028cd87e3cd9d8112ad1ed7d868516612.md):
