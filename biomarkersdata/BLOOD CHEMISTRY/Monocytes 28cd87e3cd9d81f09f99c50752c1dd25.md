# Monocytes

Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that are part of our 'secondary' response system against infections and inflammation; essentially these act as a clean up system and remove dead cells and tissue debris. Monocytes tend to rise towards the end of an infection or in the case of chronic inflammation.

### Optimal Values

0.3-0.5 x10e3/ul

### Low Monocytes

- May not always be of clinical significance
- Immunosuppressive medications
- Medical conditions that affect the bone marrow (e.g. HIV)
- Chronic immune dysregulation / intestinal permeability

### High Monocytes

- Chronic inflammation
- End stage of a viral infection
- Urinary tract congestion (e.g. BPH)
- Parasitic infections
- Non alcoholic fatty liver

### What next?

- High monocytes + high AST and ALT + high lymphocytes + high LDH may be seen in the second week or ***recovery phase of a viral infection.***
- High monocyte + high eosinophils + low neutrophils + high basophils + high ALP + high or low globulin + low iron may be seen in ***parasitic infections.***
- High monocytes + PSA could suggest ***benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH).***
