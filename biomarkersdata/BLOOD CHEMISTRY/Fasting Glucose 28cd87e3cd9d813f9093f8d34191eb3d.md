# Fasting Glucose

Blood glucose is the body's primary energy source, and is regulated by the liver and a range of adrenal and gut hormones. An elevated blood glucose is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunctions, while a decreased blood glucose level is associated with hypoglycemic tendencies. It is important to note that fasting glucose is a variable marker that can be influenced by factors like stress, activity, and time of day, and should be assessed against other markers and signs and symptoms.

### Optimal Values

4.44-5.0mmol/L     or 

80-90mg/dl

### Low Fasting Glucose

- Hypoadrenal function
- Hypothyroidism
- Hypoglycemia
- Nutrient deficiencies

### High Fasting Glucose

- Insulin resistance
- Fatty liver
- Pancreatic dysfunction
- Hyperadrenal function / acute stress
- Hyperthyroidism
- Pregnancy

### What next?

→ If **fasting glucose is low** and LDH is low, ***suspect hypoglycemia***.
→ If **fasting glucose is low** and sodium is low/normal with a high/normal potassium, ***suspect hypoadrenal function.***
→ If **fasting glucose is low** and Urea or ALT or AST are low, and the person is dieting, under eating, or plant based, ***consider nutrient deficiencies.***

→ If **fasting glucose is high** and GGT, Triglycerides, AST or ALT are high, ***consider fatty liver / metabolic dysfunction.***

→ Assess against TSH, FT3, and FT4 for interfering thyroid irregularities.
