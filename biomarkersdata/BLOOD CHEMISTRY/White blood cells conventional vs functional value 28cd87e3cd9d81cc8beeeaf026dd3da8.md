# White blood cells: conventional vs functional values

Here's a short educational video where I discuss White Blood Cells on a blood test and some of the differences between the conventional values and the functional values. There aren't agreed upon functional values, but these are some of the things I consider and think about when I derive my functional values. ***As you can see in the video, conventional value are often clearly associated with an increased risk of death.*** 

The studies I mention in the video are listed below.
