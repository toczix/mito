# Total Bilirubin

Bilirubin is a by-product of broken down red blood cells. There are two forms (indirect / direct), and Total Bilirubin measures the total of both of these. Bilirubin is a fat soluble antioxidant and requires zinc to convert the precursor of bilirubin (biliverdin) into bilirubin. Bilirubin mixes with bile once it is conjugated and before it is eliminated.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal values

5-13.6umol/L OR 0.29-0.8mg/dl

### Low Total Bilirubin

- Oxidative stress
- Zinc deficiency

### High Total Bilirubin

- Increased red blood cell breakdown
- Gilbert's Syndrome
- Bile duct obstruction
- Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
- Liver dysfunction

<aside>
👋 Note: It is possible that zinc plays a role in regulating bilirubin levels, but this is not entirely clear.

### What next?

→ If **Bilirubin is low** + high GGT + low uric acid ***may suggest oxidative stress.***
→ **Low Bilirubin** + low ALP ***may suggest low zinc.***

→ **High Bilirubin** + high AST + high ALT + high GGT + high ALP ***may suggest gallbladder dysfunction.***

→ If the lab tested the two individual Bilirubin types (direct / indirect) then assess these to see which is high.
