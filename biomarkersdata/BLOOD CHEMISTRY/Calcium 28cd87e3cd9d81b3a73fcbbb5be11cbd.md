# Calcium

Around 99% of calcium is found within bones. Calcium levels are mostly regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and by Vitamin D, therefore calcium levels are primarily a reflection of calcium metabolism and intake of dietary calcium only plays a small role in serum calcium levels (so should not be the first place we look when levels are out). PTH is secreted by the Parathyroid glands and regulates calcium reabsorption from urine, while Vitamin D increases absorption of calcium in the intestines.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal values

2.3-2.45mmol/L or 9.22-9.8mg/dl

### Low Calcium

Low intake or absorption
Intestinal damage (e.g. IBD)
Parathyroid hypofunction
Vitamin D deficiency
Low magnesium

### High Calcium

Parathyroid hyperfunction
Excess vitamin D
Adrenal hypofunction

### What next?

**→** ***If calcium is high or low***, assess for factors that could influence absorption (e.g. Vitamin D levels, medical conditions like Crohn's disease, thyroid dysfunction). 
***If consistently or significantly out of range***, consider testing Parathyroid Hormone levels (PTH).
