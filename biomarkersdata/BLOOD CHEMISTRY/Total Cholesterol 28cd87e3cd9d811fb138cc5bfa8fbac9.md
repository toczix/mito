# Total Cholesterol

Cholesterol is an essential constituent of cell membranes and a precursor for steroidal hormones and bile acids. Cholesterol is found in every cell in the body, as well as the plasma, and is mostly made in the liver (however some is made in other organs and some is sourced from diet). 

Total Cholesterol is calculated by adding LDL Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, and 20% of triglyceride levels. These tests do not measure lipoprotein particle number, and as such are poor at identifying cardiovascular risk.

### Low Total Cholesterol

- Liver dysfunction
- Hyperthyroidism
- Low fat intake / fat malabsorption
- Chronic inflammation
- Some studies show association with low steroidal hormones

### High Total Cholesterol

- Biliary insufficiency / gallbladder dysfunction
- Hypothyroidism
- High Insulin
- Gene variations
- Pregnancy

### What next?

→ If **Total Cholesterol is high or low**, assess against ***thyroid markers*** (TSH, FT3, FT4), and ***liver / gallbladder markers*** (bilirubin, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP) as → ***thyroid dysfunction and gallbladder / biliary dysfunction are two common causes*** of irregular Total Cholesterol.
