# GGT

GGT (Gamma Glutamyl Tansferase) is a liver enzyme found predominantly in the liver / biliary tree (however also in kidney, pancreas, and prostate). Because GGT is found in high amounts in biliary tract cells, it is elevated with biliary damage or obstruction. GGT is also involved in breaking down and synthesising Glutathione (an antioxidant). Alcohol consumption will increase GGT levels.

### Optimal values

12-24IU/L 

<aside>
💡 Note: Some studies assessing mortality risk suggest females may safely be 1-2 points lower than this.

### Low GGT

- Low amino acid / glutathione precursors
- Hypothyroidism
- Negative gram bacteria overgrowth (while this isn't established in the literature, this is a pattern I have seen in many clients)

### High GGT

- Excess glutathione breakdown
- Toxin exposure (e.g. xenobiotics)
- Biliary dysfunction
- Oxidative stress
- Excess alcohol consumption
- Fatty liver
- Magnesium deficiency

### What next?

→ Assess against other liver enzymes!
→ If ***GGT is elevated*** + ALT and AST are slightly elevated + elevated triglycerides **consider fatty liver.**
→ If ***GGT is elevated*** + ALP is elevated + Bilirubin is elevated **consider biliary dysfunction**.
→ If ***GGT is elevated*** + Bilirubin is low + Uric Acid is low **consider oxidative stress**.
