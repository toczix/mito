# Triglyceride-glucose index

**These two routine markers can be a valuable tool in early detection of metabolic and cardiovascular conditions.** 

One study found that the triglyceride-glucose index had an over 80% accuracy in identifying people who had insulin resistance (1). Additional studies have found the index to be accurate at identifying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and to be a better predictor than the liver enzyme, ALT (2,3). The index has also been shown to be an accurate predictor of future cardiovascular events, even in people with no suspected cardiovascular disease risk (4,5).

**Based on the findings around insulin resistance, a triglyceride-glucose index of <4.5 appears optimal.** 

Below is a simple calculator that can be used to determine the triglyceride-glucose index (note, this is in US units, international units will have to be converted before being entered into the calculator!)
