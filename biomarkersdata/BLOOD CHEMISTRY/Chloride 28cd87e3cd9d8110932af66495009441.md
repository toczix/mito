# Chloride

Chloride is a negatively charged ion regulated by the kidneys and involved in the acid-base balance in the body. Chloride is essential in the production of stomach acid so is associated with hypochlorhydria. Chloride and sodium have a reciprocal relationship, so chloride levels will often follow sodium and be affected by the same things that affects sodium.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal values

100-105mmol/L

### Low chloride

- Vomiting
- Metabolic alkalosis
- Hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid)
- Adrenal insufficiency

### High chloride

- Acidosis
- Hyperventilation (respiratory alkalosis)
- Kidney dysfunction
- Diarrhea
- Dehydration

### What next?

- **Low chloride** + low sodium + high/normal potassium + low/normal glucose may suggest adrenal insufficiency
- **Low chloride** + high CO2 + low calcium + low potassium may suggest metabolic alkalosis
- **Low chloride** + high MCV + low iron / ferritin + low ALP + low gastrin may suggest hypochlorhydria

- **High chloride** + low CO2 may suggest metabolic acidosis
- **High chloride** + low CO2 + high RBC + high hemoglobin + high BUN + high sodium + high potassium + high albumin may suggest dehydration
