# High Bilirubin and Gilberts Syndrome

Gilbert's syndrome is a genetic condition in which the liver doesn't properly process bilirubin. Due to higher levels of bilirubin being present, some symptoms such as yellowing of eyes and skin may be present. This is due to an issue with the enzyme glucuronosyltransferase - this enzyme is responsible for converting bilirubin into different forms. Ultimately this means that people with Gilbert's syndrome have much higher levels of a particular form of bilirubin; Indirect or Unconjugated Bilirubin.

Bilirubin is almost always measured in its 'Total' form, the combination of indirect and direct (or unconjugated and conjugated). Because of this, a medical diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome is generally made based on an elevated level of Total Bilirubin. This is inaccurate however, as things like biliary duct obstructions cause elevated direct / conjugated bilirubin which could also cause elevated Total Bilirubin.

Therefore, if Gilbert's syndrome is suspected, a further test that measures the Indirect and Direct (or unconjugated and conjugated) forms of Bilirubin must be measured. If Indirect / Unconjugated Bilirubin is high (e.g. above 12umol/L or 0.70mg/dl) then this is indicative of Gilbert's syndrome.

### Gilbert's Syndrome Pattern

**→** Indirect / Unconjugated Bilirubin is elevated (>12umol/L or 0.70mg/dl)
**→** Total Bilirubin is elevated (>13.6umol/L or 0.8mg/dl)
