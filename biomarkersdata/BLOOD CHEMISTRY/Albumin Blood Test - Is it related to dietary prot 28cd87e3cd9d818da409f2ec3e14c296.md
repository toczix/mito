# Albumin Blood Test - Is it related to dietary protein or stomach acid?

For those of you interested in bloodwork, you will quickly learn that a lot of the bloodwork education out there is based on anecdote, which can easily lead to misconceptions and falsehoods that get repeated and re-taught.  A passion of mine is to question what we have been taught about bloodwork and test it against research to see if it adds up. Hopefully you find some of my findings interesting.

Albumin is a protein synthesised in the liver, it is involved in transportation, binding, and regulating hydration. Many people discuss low Albumin as an indication of low protein intake or low stomach acid (causing impaired protein metabolism), and if low Albumin is observed the recommendations are often dietary - but is this accurate based on the research?

- Studies have shown that increased dietary protein intake may increase the synthesis of albumin in the liver, however this did not translate into a higher serum albumin (what we see on a blood test) (1). Furthermore, many conditions or states that have been associated with decreased serum albumin levels (e.g. pregnancy and infection) actually exhibit increased albumin synthesis rates (2).
- Some studies have found that in kidney disease patients there may be a relationship between extremely low serum albumin levels and dietary protein intake, however these results are mixed. One study found higher protein intakes actually increased albumin loss and lower protein intake actually increased serum albumin levels (3), however more recent studies in kidney disease patients have found that using a whey supplement and increasing protein intake did increase serum albumin levels in kidney disease patients (4).
- Low serum albumin levels have been associated with worse mortality outcomes in hospitalised patients, and is of high importance, however extrapolating the results of these studies in general populations or healthy people is extremely questionable (5).
- Regarding low serum albumin levels and low stomach acid, I have been unable to find any compelling research or data to support this claim.

👋 ***Based on my understanding of the current literature, I cannot see any reason to use serum albumin as a proxy for dietary protein intake or stomach acid levels in the general population.***
