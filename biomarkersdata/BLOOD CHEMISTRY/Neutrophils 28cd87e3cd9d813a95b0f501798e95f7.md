# Neutrophils

Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating white blood cell in the body. Within a matter of hours after infection occurs, Neutrophils move to the site to engulf and eliminate microbes.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal Values

3.0-4.5 x10e3/ul

### Low Neutrophils

- Chronic infection or inflammation (bacteria, viral, or parasitic are most common)
- Decreased production from bone marrow
- Parasites
- Chronic intestinal inflammation (e.g Permeability or IBD)
- Autoimmunity
- Copper deficiency

### High Neutrophils

- Acute infection or inflammation (e.g bacterial)
- Asthma
- Acute stress
- Pregnancy

### What next?

- Neutrophils are best assessed in the broader context of all white blood cells, as the ratios can be an important indicator.
- It is important to rule out pregnancy and acute illness (e.g. if someone is sick with a cold).
