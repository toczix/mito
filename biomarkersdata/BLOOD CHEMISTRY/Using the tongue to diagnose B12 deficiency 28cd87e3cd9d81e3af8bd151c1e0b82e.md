# Using the tongue to diagnose B12 deficiency

I posted recently about how 'beefy red patch' on a tongue can be used as a diagnostic test for B12 deficiency. According to the research we have, it is actually one of the best tests available, so I think it's worth discussing here in a bit more detail.

- One study assessed 81 people with serum B12 levels below 148pmol/L (which I would class as very low), compared to controls who were above this level (1) (remember though, they may still have been low by functional values)
- They assessed how many of them had an MCV level greater than 100fl (which I would also say is very high), and how many of them had 'beefy red patch' on their tongue
- 96% of those with very low serum B12 levels had a beefy red patch on their tongue, compared to 11% in the control group (remembering there may still have been some that were low in B12 by functional standards in the control group)
- Compared with MCV, only 83% in the low B12 group had an MCV above 100, compared to 6% in the control group (again, it is important to remember that 100 is very high for MCV, and I suspect a lower MCV level would have provided a more sensitive result)
- The study concluded that assessed for a beefy red patch on the tongue was more specific and sensitive than using MCV <100, however using both metrics was best
- Another study tried to assess for true B12 deficiency by enrolling participants with B12 deficiency symptoms such as oral ulcers and oral soreness and burning, they then supplemented them with B12 for a month and classed those who had resolution of symptoms as previously being B12 deficient (2)
- Of those that were in the 'B12 deficient' group, 87% had a beefy red patch on their tongue, compared to 3% in the control group
- Interestingly, they assessed different B12 levels, and using a cut off of 258pmol/L (as opposed to 148 in the above study), they found that 95% of those in the deficient group had B12 levels lower than this, compared to 24% in the control group
- Based on this study, while low B12 had a good sensitivity (ability to diagnose a deficiency), it had a relatively lower specificity (ability to rule out a deficiency) compared to a beefy red patch which had a high specificity

### Bottom line

Elevated MCV results, low serum B12 results, and the visual presence of a beefy red patch on the tongue are all diagnostically useful ways of assessing for vitamin B12 deficiency, and combining these is probably best. For those who work with clients online, it can be hard to visually assess things like the client's tongue, so generally I recommend being conscious of any complaints about sensitive tongue or oral ulcers and using these as clues to correlate to blood markers that suggest B12 deficiency.
