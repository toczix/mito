# Transferrin Saturation %

Transferrin Saturation % is a calculated valued derived by multiplying serum iron levels by 100 and dividing by the TIBC. This provides an indication of how much iron is bound to the iron transporters. Therefore, in a state of low iron, the transferrin saturation % will be reduced, and an elevated transferrin saturation % may suggest iron overload.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

Total Iron Binding Capacity ([TIBC](TIBC%2028cd87e3cd9d814b985dfc8401802a63.md)) measures the amount of iron that can be bound to transferrin (an iron binding protein produced by the liver) in the blood. While this is very similar to testing transferrin levels directly, TIBC appears to be more stable and therefore a little more reliable than a transferrin test. When the body is trying to locate and transport more iron (e.g. iron deficiency anemia) TIBC levels tend to rise, and when there is inflammation or liver damage TIBC levels decrease.

### Optimal values

20-35%

### Low Transferrin Saturation %

- Anemia of iron deficiency
- Anemia of chronic disease / infection

### High Transferrin Saturation %

- Iron overload
- Hemochromatosis
- Thalassemia
- Iron supplementation / infusion
- Acute inflammation

### What next?

→ Assess the rest of the iron panel ([Iron](Serum%20Iron%2028cd87e3cd9d81eda133f40b8bf7c556.md), [Ferritin](Ferritin%2028cd87e3cd9d81d6972df62450b6394b.md), [TIBC](TIBC%2028cd87e3cd9d814b985dfc8401802a63.md))

→ If low: Assess for reduced Ferritin with increased transferrin, suggesting iron deficiency

→ If high: Assess for increased Ferritin and Iron, consider testing for hemochromatosis
