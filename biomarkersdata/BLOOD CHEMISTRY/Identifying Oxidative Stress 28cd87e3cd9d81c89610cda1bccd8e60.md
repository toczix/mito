# Identifying Oxidative Stress

Oxidative stress is a big deal when it comes to disease and health, but it is also quite confusing! Traditionally it is thought of as an imbalance between the free radicals created by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants (while this isn't completely accurate, and oxidation isn't always bad, the general assertion that excess oxidative stress wreaks havoc on our health is still true). Things that can contribute to oxidative stress include poor diet, chemical exposure, heavy metals, UV, xenobiotics, medications, smoking, pesticides, pollution, obesity, chronic stress, iron overload, consuming oxidised fats, and chronic infection / inflammation. Oxidative stress can in turn damage cells and cell membranes, accelerate ageing, and lead to the development of cancers, cardiovascular conditions, neurodegenerative conditions, and more ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5551541/)).

### How can you pick up oxidative stress in bloodwork?

Because oxidative stress will put more pressure on our body's natural antioxidant production (e.g. uric acid, bilirubin, glutathione), assessing for irregularities with these is the best indication:

### → [**Bilirubin**](Total%20Bilirubin%2028cd87e3cd9d81569fd8da19622832d4.md)

*This is a fat soluble antioxidant. **High levels** may suggest an acute demand and **low levels** suggest we have depleted bilirubin.*

### **→ [High GGT](GGT%2028cd87e3cd9d813b916ec86882bc2358.md)**

*This is representative of how much glutathione we are breaking down. **High levels** suggest we are excessively breaking down glutathione - one of our body's primary antioxidants.*

### **→ Uric Acid**

*This is a water soluble antioxidant. **High levels** may suggest acute demand and **low levels** suggest we have depleted uric acid.*

### **Most commonly chronic oxidative stress**

will appear as 

**→ low Bilirubin** (<5umol/L OR 0.29mg/dL), 

**→ low Uric acid** (<220umol/L or 370mg/dL for men AND <190umol/L or 3.2mg/dL for women)

**→** and **high GGT** (>24IU/L)
