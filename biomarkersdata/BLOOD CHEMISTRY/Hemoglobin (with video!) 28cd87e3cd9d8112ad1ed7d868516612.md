# Hemoglobin (with video!)

Hemoglobin is usually the first blood marker you will see on a blood test. Hemoglobin is a protein molecule that carries oxygen in your blood. Anemia is the inability to deliver oxygen to tissues, so assessing hemoglobin is key for assessing anemia. 

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal Values

Females: 135-145g/L or 13.5-14.5 g/dl

Males: 145-155g/L or 14.5-15.5 g/dl

### Low Hemoglobin

- Anemia (caused by low iron, B vitamins, copper, magnesium, blood loss/ donating blood / heavy periods, low stomach acid causing malabsorption)
- Pregnancy (due to increased blood volume)

### High Hemoglobin

- Dehydration (common causes are low water intake, excess exercise, parasites)
- Asthma / Emphysema (due to impaired oxygen levels, red blood cells increase to try and increase oxygenation)

### What next?

If Hemoglobin is low or high, now it’s time to become a detective! Assess other red blood cell markers, Ferritin, AST, ALT, Homocysteine etc, to identify the likely nutrient deficiencies. Assess Albumin, Urea, and Electrolytes to identify dehydration. Assess client symptoms and nutritional habits. 

## Expanding on Hemoglobin

I regularly get requests for more bloodwork content, so I thought I would do a short video on individual markers and discuss a bit more around the nuance of how I interpret it, what kinds of things I consider if its high or low, some common interpretation mistakes, etc.

Blood work interpretation isn't always black and white, and I think learning to identify some nuance and 'grey' area with interpretation is essential.

Hopefully something here is helpful for those of you interested in assessing your own or others' blood work.
