# Globulin

Globulin is the total of all the different globulins in the blood (which are transporters or immune proteins; e.g. IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, beta and alpha globulins). Therefore a high or low globulin is indicative of abnormalities in one or more globulin types (IgG is the most abundant type, so it is most likely to influence serum Globulin).

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal values

22-28g/L or 2.2-2.8g/dL

### Low Globulin

- Immune insufficiency
- Chronic inflammation / intestinal permeability
- Anemia

### High Globulin

- Inflammation / infection / intestinal inflammation
- Autoimmunity
- Gallbladder dysfunction
- Parasites
- Elevated estrogen (e.g. oral contraceptive pill)
- Low serotonin (tryptophan is depleted by elevated globulin)

### What next?

→ **Low Globulin** + low neutrophils + low lymphocytes + low monocytes + low eosinophils ***may suggest chronic inflammation / immune suppression.***

**→** Assess for use of estrogens (e.g. birth control) **if Globulin is elevated**.
**→** Assess for symptoms of low serotonin (e.g. sleep disturbances, low mood) **if Globulin is elevated.**

Globulin is comprised of different proteins, below is a rough breakdown of these different proteins. Understanding which are the most abundant proteins measured in a globulin test can help you interpret the test result specific to your client.

**Alpha-1 Globulins:** Typically less than 10%.
(E.g. Proteins that mainly regulate enzyme activity)

**Alpha-2 Globulins:** Typically around 20%.
(E.g. Immune proteins, copper transporters)

**Beta Globulins:** Typically 15% to 35%.
(Transferrin makes up a bit less than half of this)
(E.g, immune proteins, SHBG, and clotting proteins)

**Gamma Globulins:** Typically 25% to 45%, or more (depending on the immune status of the individual)
IgG ~ 80%
IgA ~ 15%
IgM ~5%
IgD ~1%
IgE ~1%
