# Parasites and Eosinophils

Rant incoming:
Over the last few years it has become incredibly trendy in the functional health space to talk about parasites. One thing that practitioners in this space LOVE to discuss is how to spot parasites in bloodwork (as someone who has assessed several thousand blood reports, I can tell you parasites have a very tricky pattern and often don't play by the rules). 

Part of the reason for this, is there are many types of parasites and worms, and these different types cause very different effects and different inflammatory and immune mechanisms.

If we look at most of the information being circulated, you will see the most commonly discussed blood marker is Eosinophils. 

I have heard endless functional practitioners claim a high Eosinophils is almost always a sign of parasites - and there is some truth to this (you'll notice I even listed it in my [bloodwork post on Eosinophils](Eosinophils%2028cd87e3cd9d819bb86cdbe178152934.md)). However there is a lot more to the story, let me briefly summarise it:

- Eosinophils are a white blood cell that responds to immune activation, in particular by a cytokine called IL5
- Some parasites and worms are known to have a very stimulatory effect on IL5, therefore causing high Eosinophils
- The parasites that do this are specific however, most commonly worms and helminths (these are multi cellular organisms, while Protozoa parasites are single cell organisms)
- While these organisms are found all over the world, including developed countries, they are rarely responsible for IBS symptoms. Most commonly it is Protozoan parasites that are associated with IBS symptoms (e.g. Blastocystis Hominis, Dientamoeba Fragilis, and Giardia)
- While some studies have found some IL5 and Eosinophil activity in these types of parasites, majority of studies do not find this to be common

### Bottom line:

Elevated Eosinophils can be caused by some parasites (mostly worms), but is unlikely something you will commonly see with intestinal parasites that could be causing someone's digestive symptoms. This assertion is a classic example of the misapplication of a mechanism, but not real world observation
