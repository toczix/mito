# WBC

**Total White Blood Cell Count**

WBC measures the sum of all the white blood cells in the blood. White blood cells are part of our immune system and fight infections. There are five types of white blood cells (Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, and Basophils), with each type playing a different role. 
For this reason it is essential to always look at the specific white blood cell markers (differentials) to determine which cells are high or low. 

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

**Note:** *Some white blood cells could be high while others could be low, making the WBC appear 'normal'.*

### Optimal Values

5.5-7.5 x10e3/ul

### Low WBC

- Chronic infection or inflammation (bacteria, viral, or parasitic are most common)
- Autoimmunity
- Decreased production from bone marrow

### High WBC

- Acute infection or inflammation (bacterial / viral are most common)
- Diet high in sugar and refined carbohydrates
- Acute stress

### What next?

**Always assess WBC with the differentials - specifically white blood cell markers**; 
and especially **Neutrophils** and **Lymphocyte**, as these make up the majority of the total white blood cell count and will provide a much more accurate depiction.
