# AST, ALT, and B6

AST and ALT are liver enzymes (found throughout the body, but in high concentration in the liver). We have discussed both [AST](AST%2028cd87e3cd9d81c8bbc3f8bda54a6dda.md) and [ALT](ALT%2028cd87e3cd9d81449987e6a2792ab4b6.md) previously, however I've just discovered an interesting testing update which practitioners should be aware of.

Traditionally low AST and ALT are seen as indications of low B6 (because they both require B6 as a co factor for their activity). This can be a helpful pattern to look for, and may help ascertain the nutritional status of someone's diet. However, recently some labs have updated their testing by adding in a B6 co factor. This means that people who previously would have registered a low test result (due to insufficient B6) will now appear normal. This is a positive as it provides a clearer representation of their liver enzymes and liver burden, but it's also a negative as it takes away the ability to highlight a B6 deficiency.

Unfortunately this isn't common practice in all labs yet, and most labs don't disclose their specific testing processes - adding a complexity to blood chemistry interpretation.
