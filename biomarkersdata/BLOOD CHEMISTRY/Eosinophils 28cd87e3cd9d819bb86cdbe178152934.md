# Eosinophils

Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that respond to antibodies that are produced in response to an antigen entering the body (foreign substances). This means that eosinophils are likely to be elevated alongside allergies. Eosinophils are found largely in the intestines and the lungs.

### High eosinophils

- Allergies (e.g food or environmental)
- Asthma
- Low cortisol
- Some parasitic infections, eg worms may cause elevated easinophils
- Some medication use may cause elevated eosinophils

### What next?

- High high eosinophils + high monocytes + low neutrophils + high basophils + high ALP + high or low globulin + low iron ***may be seen in parasitic infections.***
- High eosinophils + high hemoglobin + high RBC+ high HCT ***may be seen in asthma.***
