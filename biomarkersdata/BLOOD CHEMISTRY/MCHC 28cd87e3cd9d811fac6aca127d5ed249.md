# MCHC

**Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration**

MCHC measures the average concentration of hemoglobin inside red blood cells. This is very similar to MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin), except MCHC takes into consideration the size of the red blood cell, whereas MCH is only assessing hemoglobin amount irrespective of the cell size.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal Values

32-35g/dl OR 320-350g/l

### Low MCHC

- Anemia (caused by low iron, B6, blood loss)
- Heavy metal burden
- Vitamin C need
- Thalassemia (a genetic disorder with abnormal hemoglobin)

### High MCHC

- Anemia (B12/B9)
- Nutrient malabsorption (e.g. hypochlorhydria, celiac disease, gut permeability)
- Excess alcohol intake

### What next?

***If MCHC is low or high, correlate to other markers.***

→ **Low MCHC** + low MCH, low RBC, low MCV, low HCT, low hemoglobin, low iron, low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, high RDW **could suggest iron deficiency**

→ **High MCHC** + high MCH, high RBC, high MCV, high HCT, high MCHC, high LDH, high RDW, low serum B12, low serum folate **could suggest B12/B9 deficiency**
