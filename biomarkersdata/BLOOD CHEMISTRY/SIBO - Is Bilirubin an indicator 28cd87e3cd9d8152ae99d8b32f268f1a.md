# SIBO - Is Bilirubin an indicator?

We've discussed how there are some blood test markers that can potentially indicate SIBO when assessed in correlation with symptoms and individual context. Another marker that I use when assessing for SIBO is bilirubin. 2019 research found that total Bilirubin was associated with SIBO in IBS-D patients (1). Bilirubin exerts anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and may raise in the case of SIBO. 

This research also found that treating SIBO led to a reduction in Bilirubin levels. Some of the researchers even wrote a recent review suggesting that simple blood markers (such as elevated Bilirubin) could be used to suspect SIBO in a primary care setting (2). Interestingly, while SIBO may lead to an elevation in Bilirubin (due to Bilirubin's protective properties), some research suggests that elevated Bilirubin may also be a risk factor for developing dysbiosis in the first place (due to a correlation with impaired bile flow) (3).

### Bottom line

Bilirubin may be elevated in cases of SIBO due to a number of potential mechanisms, making it a useful blood marker to assess for when suspecting SIBO.
