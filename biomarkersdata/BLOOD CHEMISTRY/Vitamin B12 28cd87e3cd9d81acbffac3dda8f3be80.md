# Vitamin B12

Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient derived from animal products required for the synthesis of DNA, red blood cell maturation, and nerves. Vitamin B12 requires intrinsic factor (produced by the stomach) for transportation, and is absorbed in the ileum (the final part of the small intestine). Excess Vitamin B12 is stored in the liver, and therefore deficiency caused by diet can take a while to become evident. Low levels are associated with malabsorption, dietary insufficiency, bacterial overgrowth, and excess levels are associated with a functional deficiency (poor cell uptake), excess supplementation, and diseased states.

A Vitamin B12 blood test measures total circulating B12 (this includes active and inactive forms bound to transport proteins, with most of it being inactive). Interestingly, the inactive transport protein (Haptocorrin) is largely produced by neutrophils. Because this is testing both active and inactive forms, a high or normal B12 result may not always show adequate B12 levels. 

### Optimal values

350-650pmol/L
474-880pg/ml

### Low Vitamin B12

- Low animal protein intake
- Low stomach acid / gastritis
- Megaloblastic anemia
- SIBO
- Dementia
- Metformin or PPI use
- Hypothyroidism

### High Vitamin B12

- Excess supplementation
- Functional deficiency (may exhibit deficiency symptoms)
- Liver or kidney dysfunction
- High neutrophil activity
- Cancer

### What next

→ If Vitamin B12 is low, assess for high MCV to indicate suspected B12 deficiency.

→ If Vitamin B12 is high, assess for deficiency symptoms, enquire around supplementation habits, and assess immune markers (e.g. white blood cells)
