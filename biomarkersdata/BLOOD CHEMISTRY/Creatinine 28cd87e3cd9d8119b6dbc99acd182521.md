# Creatinine

Creatinine is a byproduct of creatine. Creatine is found in skeletal muscle, therefore creatinine is a byproduct of skeletal muscle and is cleared by the kidneys. The more muscle mass someone has, the higher their creatinine levels will be (and vice vesa).

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal values

60-100umol/L or 0.68-1.13mg/dl

### Low Creatinine

- Low protein intake / malabsorption
- Low muscle mass
- **Low creatinine is especially common in plant based dieters and elderly people.*

### High Creatinine

- Kidney insufficiency
- Dehydration
- Hyperthyroidism
- Increased muscle mass
- Parasitic infections
- **Creatine supplementation will cause a mild increase.*

### What next?

**→ Low Creatinine** + low BUN + high MCV + low ALP may suggest low protein intake / malnourishment

**→ High Creatinine** + high BUN may be seen in kidney insufficiency
