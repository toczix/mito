# Just how much does SHBG affect total globulin levels?

Globulin is a blood marker comprised of different proteins. I have discussed globulin before, including the different proteins that make up total globulin (check the Notion link for more information). Today I wanted to discuss one specific protein - SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin). There are some that claim that because SHBG is one of the proteins measured in total globulin, then a high SHBG could be the primary cause of an elevated globulin reading. While this sounds logical, personally I have never seen anyone or any studies ascertain just how much SHBG may really influence these levels. 

So I tried to work it out, and this is where I've landed:

- Let's use a total globulin reading of 26g/L for our example
- Roughly 25% of total globulin is comprised of beta globulins (it is the second largest group, after gamma globulins)
- This means that around 6.5g/L of our total globulin is coming from beta globulins
- Beta globulins contain a range of proteins, but roughly half is made up of transferrin. A normal transferrin result converts to around 3.25g/l (this stacks up with our estimated 6.5g/L coming from beta globulins). This means that the remaining 3.25g/l from beta globulins is coming from a mix of other proteins, including SHBG
- However, if we convert SHBG (which is measured in nmol/l) into g/L, even at a high SHBG result of 100nmol/l (above optimal levels), this still equals less than 0.01g/L. This means that about 1/3 of a percent of the remaining beta globulins is coming from SHBG
- Therefore, this means that SHBG, even at levels well above the optimal values would probably be too minor to even change the total globulin score, as it could theoretically shift our 26g/L example to 26.01g/L, and most tests aren't sensitive enough to measure these minor changes

### Bottom Line

While SHBG does indeed contribute to total globulin levels, when we consider the amount of SHBG likely to be present, it likely accounts for less than half a percent of our total globulin reading - making it a poor explanation for elevated globulin levels.
