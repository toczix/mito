# MCH

**MEAN CORPUSCULAR HEMOGLOBIN**

MCH is a calculated value of the average weight of hemoglobin inside a red blood cell (the higher the MCH, the more hemoglobin is present). 

MCH can be beneficial when comparing to other anemia markers to determine the type of anemia that may be present.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal Values

28-32pg

### Low MCH

- Anemia (caused by low iron, B6, blood loss)
- Heavy metal burden
- Vitamin C need
- Thalassemia (a genetic disorder with abnormal hemoglobin)

### High MCH

- Anemia (B12/B9)
- Nutrient malabsorption (e.g. hypochlorhydria, celiac disease, gut permeability)
- Excess alcohol intake

### What next?

***If MCH is low or high, correlate to other markers.***

- Low MCH + low RBC, low MCV, low HCT, low hemoglobin, low iron, low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, high RDW could suggest **iron deficiency**.
- High MCH + high RBC, high MCV, high HCT, high MCHC, high LDH, high RDW, low serum B12, low serum folate could suggest **B12/B9 deficiency**.
