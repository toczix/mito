# How pregnancy affects bloodwork

There are a number of markers that are heavily affected by pregnancy, many practitioners are unaware of these, and it makes interpreting a pregnant person's blood test very challenging. Below are the main markers that will commonly be affected in a standard blood test, most of these are normal changes and are not concerning observations:

**Hemoglobin** **decreases** (due to increase in blood volume)

**MCV increases slightly** (due to increased production of red blood cells)

**HCT decreases slightly** (due to changes in blood volume)

**Neutrophils increase** (partly due to increased physiological stress and partly due to slower cell death)

**Lymphocytes fluctuate** (decrease initially, then increase)

**Platelets decrease** (due to increased platelet activation and clearance)

**Albumin decreases** (due to increased blood volume)

**Creatinine decreases** (due to increased kidney function)

**Urea decreases** (due to increased kidney function)

**Sodium slightly decreases** (due to increased blood volume)

**Uric acid decreases** (due to increased kidney function)

**ALP increases significantly** (due to high activity in the placenta)

**Cholesterol increases** (supports growth of the fetus)

**Triglycerides increase** (supports growth of the fetus)
