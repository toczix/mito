# Thyroglobulin Antibodies

Thyroglobulin is produced by follicular cells in the thyroid, an elevation in Thyroglobulin antibodies suggests that the individual is having an immune response and attacking the thyroglobulin protein (this protein contains iodine, and it appears that it is the iodine specifically that may exacerbate the immune response). An elevation in Thyroglobulin antibodies is present in roughly 3/4 of people with autoimmune thyroid disease, however around 15% of people with elevated thyroglobulin antibodies have normal thyroid function. Thyroglobulin antibodies are generally considered less significant than TPO antibodies, which are more representative of the immune response.

### Optimal Values

Different labs measure Thyroglobulin antibodies differently, therefore refer to the lab specific reference range

**Low Thyroglobulin Antibodies**

→ No clinical significance (a low test result is desirable)

**High Thyroglobulin Antibodies**

→ Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (autoimmune hypothyroidism)
→ Grave's disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism)
→ Excess iodine intake may be associated with further increasing Thyroglobulin antibodies

### What’s next?

Assess full thyroid panel (including TSH, FT4, FT3 and TPO antibodies). In some cases thyroid replacement may be required.
