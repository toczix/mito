# White blood cells, absolutes vs percentages

On a blood report, specific white blood cell types are either reported in percentage of the total white cells, or as absolute numbers which measures the number of that specific white blood cell per unit (microlitre) of blood.

Some practitioners teach and work off percentages, while others (like myself) work off the absolutes. While these are both viable ways of presenting white blood cell results, I believe that percentages can often be very misleading without thinking of them in absolute terms.

Here is a short video **where I show a white blood cell panel that has both the percentages and the absolutes listed, and explain why working off percentages could incorrectly skew your interpretation.**
