# Multivitamins interfere with thyroid tests

Sometimes common things can interfere with accurate blood test results, leaving the practitioner and client scratching their heads. One such scenario can be biotin supplementation and the affect on thyroid markers. Biotin (a common B vitamin supplement used in multivitamins and hair, skin and nail supplements) interferes with the testing method for thyroid hormones. As such, higher doses of biotin can return lab results similar to that seen with Grave's disease, leading to inaccurate diagnoses (1). Interestingly, some reports suggest that even lower doses may interfere with thyroid labs depending on timing. 

It is possible that doses found in some multivitamin supplements could interfere with lab results for a couple of hours after ingestion, while doses commonly taken in hair, skin, and nail supplements could continue to interfere with lab results for 8-24 hours (2). One study performed in 1,944 outpatients found that over 7% of people had biotin levels high enough to interfere with lab results (3).

## Bottom line

Regular biotin supplementation is very common through multivitamins and hair, skin, and nail supplements. Many of these formulations contain biotin dosages that could significantly interfere with thyroid lab results, leading to inaccurate diagnosis. A washout period of 1-2 days is recommended for those taking biotin supplements, and asking a client with irregular hyperthyroid test results about supplementation use is wise.
