/~:1 Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <a.Button-module__dZsqfa__button Interactive2-module__IAGpQq__root Interactive2-module__IAGpQq__transition Interactive2-module__IAGpQq__focus Interactive2-module__IAGpQq__disabled Interactive2-module__IAGpQq__nofill Interactive2-module__IAGpQq__border Interactive2-module__IAGpQq__borderRadius>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <div> null
