# Identifying PCOS

PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) is essentially a condition that causes androgen excess and anovulatory cycles in women. Contrary to what the name suggests, ovarian cysts are not a necessary part of the diagnosis (and therefore, can not be used alone as a diagnostic tool). 
***The most common cause driver of PCOS is insulin resistance, however inflammation and adrenals can play a role in a minority of cases.***

### How might PCOS appear in bloodwork?

- Fasting Glucose elevated (>4.9mmol/L)
- Fasting Insulin elevated (>6mg/dl)

*Note, about 25% of people with PCOS may have normal glucose and insulin function

- SHBG decreased (<40nmol/L)
- Free testosterone elevated (>15pmol/L)

*Note, in some cases SHBG and free testosterone may be normal, and DHEA will be elevated instead

- LH/FSH ratio elevated (2:1)
