# Serum Magnesium

Magnesium is an essential mineral that is involved in hundreds of bodily processes, including nerve and muscle function, cardiovascular health, glucose metabolism, energy production, blood pressure regulation, and bone health. The vast majority of magnesium is found within bones and within cells, with only about 1-5% being found extra cellularly (this is what is tested on a serum magnesium blood test). Based on this test measuring a very small amount of total magnesium, it is not uncommon for people to fall within the conventional reference range for magnesium and yet have a subclinical magnesium deficiency.

0.9-1.0mmol/L or 2.19-2.43mg/dl

### Low Serum Magnesium

- Adrenal hyperfunction
- Excessive alcohol intake
- Fluid loss (e.g. diarrhea)
- Metabolic dysfunction

### High Serum Magnesium

- Hypothyroid

- Adrenal insufficiency
- Excess breakdown of red blood cells

### What next?

**→** Assess other adrenal markers (e.g. sodium, potassium, glucose)
**→** Assess kidney markers (e.g. urea, creatinine, uric acid)
**→** Assess lifestyle factors (e.g. alcohol intake, hydration status, dietary / supplemental intake)
