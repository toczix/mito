# Platelets

Platelets are involved in clotting, vascular integrity and vasoconstriction. They also form 'plugs', plugging up breaks in vessels. Platelets have a lifespan of around 7-10 days.

### What next?

- Low platelets + high bilirubin + high BUN + evidence of anemia (e.g. low RBC, low MCH, low MCHC, low hemoglobin) ***could suggest heavy metal toxicity.***

- High platelets + high triglycerides + low HDL cholesterol + high LDL cholesterol ***could suggest atherosclerosis.***
