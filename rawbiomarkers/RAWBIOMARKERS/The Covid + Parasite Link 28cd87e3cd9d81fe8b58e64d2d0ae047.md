# The Covid + Parasite Link

A study was just published which assessed stool tests in 833 Italian patients who presented with diarrhoea (1). Of these patients, 3.9% were Covid positive. Of those who were Covid positive, 18.5% had a protozoan parasite, and 16% had the parasite Blastocystis (compared to just 1.1% in the Covid negative group). Previous research has linked Covid (and also Long Covid) with other dysbiotic states (e.g. fungal overgrowth) (2). Based on this, while a significant number of people continue to experience gastrointestinal symptoms post Covid infection, or lingering Long Covid symptoms, it is worth assessing for any underlying gastrointestinal dysbiosis, including but not limited to parasitic infections.
