# Sample Blood Work Interpretation - Video

Hey everyone! Here is another sample blood work interpretation video, this is a real case study, and shows my thinking as I go through someone's bloods. This is a good example of where someone isn't really 'obviously' unwell with any specific conditions, but has a few potential areas we can optimise. There is also an undiagnosed genetic disorder (probably) that could cause a practitioner to really freak out if they weren't familiar with what to look for.
