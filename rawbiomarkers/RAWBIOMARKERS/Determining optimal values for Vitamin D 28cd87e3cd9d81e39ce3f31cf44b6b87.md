# Determining optimal values for Vitamin D

Hi everyone! 

On this Notion page I have some more information about [Vitamin D](Vitamin%20D%20(25%20Hydroxy%20D)%2028cd87e3cd9d81dfa5b5d786e713b7e4.md), the optimal values that I work off, and what high or low may correlate with. In this video below I discuss some of the available research we have on Vitamin D levels and how I arrived at the optimal values that I use. Remembering that there aren't any agreed upon optimal values, this video shows you what I personally consider when determining optimal blood values.
