# HCT

**Hematocrit**

Hematocrit measures the percentage of total blood volume that is made up of red blood cells, therefore it is heavily influenced by the size and number of red blood cells.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal Values

38-48% - it is common for women to be slightly lower and men to be slightly higher, but should still fall within this range

### Low HCT

- Anemia (caused by low iron, B12, B9, B6, copper, or blood loss)
- Digestive inflammation (IBD conditions have a strong correlation to low HCT levels)
- Thymus dysfunction

### High HCT

- Dehydration
- Respiratory distress (asthma, emphysema)
- Polycythemia
- Smoking
- Testosterone / steroid use
- High altitude

### What next?

***If HCT is low or high, correlate to other markers.***

- Low HCT + low RBC, low MCV, low hemoglobin, low iron, low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, high RDW could suggest **iron deficiency**
- Low HCT + high RBC, high MCV, high MCH, high MCHC, high LDH, high RDW, low serum B12, low serum folate could suggest **B12/B9 deficiency**
- High HCT + high RBC, high hemoglobin, high sodium, high potassium, high BUN, high albumin could **suggest dehydration**
