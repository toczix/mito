# TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)

TSH is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland (not the thyroid) that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. The pituitary gland is stimulated to secrete TSH by the hypothalamus. TSH can provide an indication of whether the body wants more or less thyroid hormone, with high TSH suggesting the body is wanting more thyroid hormone to be secreted. If the pituitary gland is not functioning optimally however, TSH can become misleading, and therefore TSH alone shouldn't be used to evaluate thyroid function.

### Optimal values

1.0-2.5mIU/L

<aside>
👋 Note: *I would class an 'acceptable' range in the absence of other symptoms or thyroid dysfunction as 0.5-4.5mIU/L. This is based on large amounts of within-person variability depending on time of day, acute stress, temperature, and season. This is why several studies suggest that majority of abnormal TSH readings normalise within a few months by themselves.*

### Low TSH

- Primary Hyperthyroidism (e.g. Grave's Disease) (thyroid gland dysfunction)
- Secondary Hypothyroidism (pituitary gland dysfunction)
- Tertiary Hypothyroidism (hypothalamus dysfunction)
- Dopamine agonists
- Recent COVID infection
- Exogenous Thyroid Hormone use
- Pregnancy
- HPA axis dysfunction

### High TSH

- Primary Hypothyroidism (e.g. Hashimoto's) (thyroid gland dysfunction)
- Lithium or fluoride exposure
- Excess iodine supplementation
- Older age (older individuals may have high TSH levels without hypothyroidism)
- Acute illness may cause an elevation in TSH

### What next?

→ Assess other thyroid markers (e.g. FT4 and FT3)
→ If TSH is high and FT4/FT3 are low, assess thyroid antibodies (e.g. TPO antibodies).
