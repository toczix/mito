# Free T4

FT4, or Free Thyroxine, is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, stimulated by the pituitary hormone TSH. FT4 measures the unbound levels of T4 in the blood, while this is only a very small amount of the total T4 level, it is a more accurate measure. Majority of the active thyroid hormone (T3) is obtained through converting T4 into T3. Abnormal FT4 levels can indicate an overactive or underactive thyroid (hyper or hypothyroidism).
