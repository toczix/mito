# HBA1C - Hemoglobin A1C

HBA1C measures glucose that is combined with hemoglobin to form glycated hemoglobin. Glycated hemoglobin is formed proportional to the amount of glucose present in the blood during the red blood cell lifespan (around 90-120 days), and therefore HBA1C is said to be representative of glucose levels over the previous 90-120 days. Because this process is reliant on average red blood cell lifespan, if someone has shorter or longer lasting red blood cells, this could influence HBA1C test results.

### Optimal values

5.0-5.3% or 31-34mmol/mol

### Low HBA1C

- Hypoglycemia
- Blood loss
- Thalassemia
- Sickle Cell Anemia
- Red blood cells with short lifespan
- Lead toxicity
- Pregnancy

### High HBA1C

- Insulin resistance
- Diabetes
- Iron deficiency
- Red blood cells with long lifespan

### What next?

→ Because of interfering factors, I don't use HBA1C as a primary marker for glucose regulation, however ***it is worth assessing alongside fasting glucose and fasting insulin***.
