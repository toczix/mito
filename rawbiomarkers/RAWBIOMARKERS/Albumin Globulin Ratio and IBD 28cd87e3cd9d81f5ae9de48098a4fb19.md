# Albumin:Globulin Ratio and IBD

In the Notion database I discuss the markers [Albumin](Albumin%2028cd87e3cd9d819ba0f1e05d2f1d7448.md) and [Globulin](Globulin%2028cd87e3cd9d810d8acaf66e5ac6ff2b.md) (as well as what I believe are optimal values). One of the properties of Albumin is that it is an acute stage negative reactant (so it decreases with inflammation). Globulin on the other hand consists of immunoglobulins and acute phase proteins such as CRP, and therefore increases with inflammation. Research has found that immunoglobulin levels are higher in people with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and that levels of globulin correlate with worse mucosal healing in people with IBD (1,2).

One of the complexities with Albumin is that it is heavily impacted by hydration status, and dehydration is a common occurrence in IBD conditions. Assessing the Albumin:Globulin ratio however can remove the interference of possible dehydration that may mask low Albumin levels. 

A low Albumin:Globulin ratio appears to be significantly correlated with active IBD conditions, and may prove as a helpful way to distinguish between IBD and other gastrointestinal problems (3). 

A helpful Albumin:Glboulin ratio to assess for is around 1.2, those with a lower ratio were significantly more likely to have IBD. 

To give you an idea of what this looks like in practice, some common examples of an Albumin:Globulin ratio of ~1.2 would be: Albumin 38 & Globulin 32. Albumin 40 & Globulin 34. Or Albumin 42 & Globulin 35.

### Bottom line

While no ratio will ever be perfect, a low Albumin:Globulin ratio is associated with active Inflammatory Bowel Disease and may help distinguish between other causes of GI symptoms.
