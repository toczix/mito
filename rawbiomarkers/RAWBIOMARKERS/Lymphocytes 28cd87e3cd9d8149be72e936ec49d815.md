# Lymphocytes

Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell; there are various forms of lymphocytes (e.g. B cells, T cells, Natural Killer cells), and these differ in the way they attack foreign microbes. When there is an infection or inflammation in the body, lymphocytes often elevate; in the case of chronic infections or a fatigued immune response then lymphocytes may be decreased.

### Optimal Values

1.1-3.1 x10e3/ul

### Low Lymphocytes

- Chronic infection or inflammation
- Zinc deficiency
- Cancer

### High Lymphocytes

- Viral infections
- IBD
- Autoimmunity
- Low cortisol
- Systemic toxicity
- Acute stress / exercise

### What next?

***Lymphocytes are best assessed against Neutrophils:***

- If Neutrophils are significantly elevated and Lymphocytes are low, suspect acute bacterial infection.
- If Neutrophils are slightly elevated and Lymphocytes are high, suspect viral infection.
- If Neutrophils are low and Lymphocytes are high, suspect autoimmunity.
- If Neutrophils AND Lymphocytes are low, suspect chronic infection / inflammation.
