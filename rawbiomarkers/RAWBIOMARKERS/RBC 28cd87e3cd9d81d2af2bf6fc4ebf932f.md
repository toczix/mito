### What next?

***If RBC is low or high, correlate to other markers.***

- Low RBC + low MCV, low hemoglobin, low iron, low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, high RDW could suggest **iron deficiency**
- Low RBC + high MCV, high MCH, high MCHC, high LDH, high RDW, low serum B12, low serum folate could suggest **B12/B9 deficiency**
- High RBC + high HCT, high hemoglobin, high sodium, high potassium, high BUN, high albumin could suggest **dehydration**
