# Identifying a Vitamin B6 Deficiency

<aside>
👋 It can be challenging to identify nutrient deficiencies in standard bloodwork, however if we identify some biological processes that are dependant on various nutrients, we can start to recognise some patterns.

</aside>

The **liver enzymes AST** and **ALT** are both **transaminase enzymes** that ***require*** ***vitamin B6*** for their activity, so if these enzymes are low it frequently suggests low vitamin B6 status. 

B6 is also required for **heme synthesis**, and therefore low levels are associated with low **hemoglobin**, low **MCV**, and low **MCH/MCHC**. 

Finally, homocysteine requires B6, B9, and B12 to be converted, therefore an elevated **homocysteine** may accompany a vitamin B6 deficiency.

## Putting it all together: Identifying a potential Vitamin B6 Deficiency
