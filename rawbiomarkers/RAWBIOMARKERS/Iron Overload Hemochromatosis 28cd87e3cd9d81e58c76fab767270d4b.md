# Iron Overload / Hemochromatosis

Iron overload is an excess of iron in the body, which can lead to organ damage, inflammation, joint pain, and skin discolouring. The most common cause of iron overload is a genetic condition called 'hemochromatosis', which is linked to two gene mutations (C282Y and H63D). Excess iron introduced into the body through supplementation, infusions, and blood transfusions (e.g. in those with Thalassemia) are additional causes of iron overload.

### Iron Overload / Hemochromatosis Pattern in Bloodwork

[Serum Iron:](Serum%20Iron%2028cd87e3cd9d81eda133f40b8bf7c556.md) High (>23.2umol/L or 130mcg/dL)
[Ferritin:](Ferritin%2028cd87e3cd9d81d6972df62450b6394b.md) Very high (>200ug/L or 200ng/ml)
[TIBC:](TIBC%2028cd87e3cd9d814b985dfc8401802a63.md) Low (<44umol/L or 250mg/dL)
[Transferrin Saturation:](Transferrin%20Saturation%20%25%2028cd87e3cd9d81299ec8e6772ccb8775.md) Very high (>45%)

A Hemochromatosis gene test (HFE) can also be performed via a blood test to help determine whether iron overload is caused by this genetic condition.
