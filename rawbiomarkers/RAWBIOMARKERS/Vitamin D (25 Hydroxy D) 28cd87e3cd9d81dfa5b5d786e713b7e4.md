# Vitamin D (25 Hydroxy D)

25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the primary circulating form of vitamin D in the blood and is used as an indicator of vitamin D status. It is produced in the liver through the hydroxylation of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), which is synthesized via exposure to sun, or obtained through diet or supplementation. Vitamin D up regulates calcium uptake in the gut, and deficiencies have been associated with impaired bone density, metabolic conditions, depression, cancers, infection, and cardiovascular disease, among others. (Note, do not confuse this test with 1,25 Dihydroxyvitamin D).

### Optimal values

125-225nmol/L or 50-90ng/ml

### Low Vitamin D

Vitamin D deficiency
Correlated with cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases, and cancer
Osteoporosis
Inflammation or infection
Autoimmunity
Genetic mutations (affecting conversion or receptors)
Medication use (e.g. cholestyramine)

### High Vitamin D

Excess supplementation
Excess calcium and kidney stone formation
Magnesium deficiency

### What next?

→ If low, assess inflammatory markers, metabolic markers, lipid markers, and consider supplementation

→ If high, cease supplementation and assess calcium levels
