# This lab mistake could cause incorrect diagnoses

For everyone who works with blood tests, I want you to really listen up. I performed an analysis this week where the blood test results were crazy, including potentially life threatening potassium levels, irregular red blood cell markers, liver enzymes, and bilirubin levels. At surface level this would have sent me down the entirely wrong direction, especially when comparing to blood tests a month prior where none of these issues were present. 

So, what gives? One word: **Hemolysis.** 

Hemolysis is when there is a breakdown of red blood cells in the blood sample (often caused by an improper blood draw or delayed analysis of the sample). This affects around 1 in 30 samples, and in some labs its as high as around 1 in 8 (and in hospital emergency department it can even be 1 in 3!) (1,2,3). Labs should have strict cutoffs for rejecting hemolyized samples, however this is lab dependant and many accept samples that have moderate hemolysis. Personally I think moderate hemolysis renders a blood test useless.

Some labs will report the hemolysis index, this is often a score between 0-3 (2 being 'moderate' and what was noted in the test I received, this is the most common cutoff used by labs). Many labs however do not report the hemolysis score on the blood test unfortunately.

### Bottom line

<aside>
👋 Do not ignore the hemolysis score on a blood test, and if you see irregular results (especially very elevated potassium or LDH) then this may be reason to question the test.
