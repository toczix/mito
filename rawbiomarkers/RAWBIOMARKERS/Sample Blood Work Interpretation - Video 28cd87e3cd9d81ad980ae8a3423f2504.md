# Sample Blood Work Interpretation - Video

Hey everyone! 

Here is another sample blood work interpretation video, this is a real case study, and shows my thinking as I go through someone's bloods. This is a really interesting case study as majority of the blood markers are quite good, however there are a few that are out that I think point to a very plausible, yet somewhat less common explanation. It is a great example of how we can't take any one marker at face value. It's a longer video, but for those of you who want to do blood work analysis, or currently offer this, hopefully you'll learn something!
