# BUN

BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) is a measurement of Urea, a waste product of amino acid metabolism which is produced by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Sometimes some labs report 'Urea' instead of BUN, these are similar but not exactly the same. BUN reflects the nitrogen content of Urea, whereas Urea tests the amount of Urea present.

### **High BUN**

- High protein diet
- Dehydration
- Kidney insufficiency
- Catabolism / Adrenal stress
- Dysbiosis (LPS)

### What next?

**→ Low BUN** + low AST + low ALT may suggest B6 insufficiency

**→ High BUN** + low CO2 + high RBC + high hemoglobin + high chloride + high sodium + high potassium + high albumin may suggest dehydration
