# Adrenal Hypofunction

You've probably heard all the debate around 'adrenal fatigue' over recent years. True adrenal insufficiency (known as Addisons disease) is very rare, and is characterised by medically low levels of adrenal hormones; however there are a lot of people who still experience adrenal dysregulation. ***This could come in the form of high adrenal activity (e.g. acute stress), or low adrenal activity (which can also result from prolonged stress or inflammation).***

### How can you pick this pattern up in bloodwork?

**When suspecting adrenal hypofunction (low adrenal activity), the following patterns may be observed:**

- Low sodium (below 137mmol/L)
- High / normal potassium (e.g. 4.5+mmol/L)
- High / normal total cholesterol (e.g. 5-7mmol/L)
- High or low blood glucose (e.g. <4.4 or >5.0mmol/L)
