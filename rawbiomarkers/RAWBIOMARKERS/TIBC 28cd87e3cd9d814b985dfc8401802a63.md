# TIBC

Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) measures the amount of iron that can be bound to transferrin (an iron binding protein produced by the liver) in the blood. While this is very similar to testing transferrin levels directly, TIBC appears to be more stable and therefore a little more reliable than a transferrin test. When the body is trying to locate and transport more iron (e.g. iron deficiency anemia) TIBC levels tend to rise, and when there is inflammation or liver damage TIBC levels decrease.

**→ If low:** Assess for irregular [white blood cells](WBC%2028cd87e3cd9d81f2a3a0d9b158192674.md) and elevated CRP / ESR if suspecting inflammation / chronic disease / infection

**→ If high:** Assess for low [ferritin](Ferritin%2028cd87e3cd9d81d6972df62450b6394b.md) if suspecting iron deficiency
