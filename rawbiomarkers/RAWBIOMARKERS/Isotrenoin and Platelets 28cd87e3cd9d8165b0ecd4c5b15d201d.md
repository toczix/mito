# Isotrenoin and Platelets

Isotretinoin (e.g. Accutane) is an orally administered retinoid used to for the treatment of acne. While there are side effects (some which can be significant), Isotretinoin is widely accepted as the most effective acne treatment available. Because of this, Isotretinoin use is quite common, and as coaches, we will undoubtedly work with clients who are taking Isotretinoin. It is relatively commonly understood that isotretinoin influences liver enzymes and lipids (increase Triglycerides and LDL cholesterol, lowers HDL cholesterol, and increases liver enzymes) (1,2). For this reason some physicians choose to monitor liver enzymes regularly while someone uses Isotretinoin. However an additional blood markers that can be overlooked is platelets. Some studies suggest Isotretinoin use can be associated with around a 10 point drop in platelet count (3). Interestingly, other documented case studies have found other inconsistencies, including elevation in platelets with Isotretinoin use. Nonetheless, being aware of these potential changes can be valuable clues when you see surprising lab results.

### Bottom line

Isotretinoin use is very common among people suffering from acne. Isotretinoin has been associated with a range of changes in blood work, from lipid skewing (Increased triglycerides, increased LDL cholesterol, and lowered HDL cholesterol), to increased liver enzymes and decreased platelets. Other case reports or studies have found white cell changes, increased platelets, decreased RDW levels, and other affected red blood cells markers in some people. Always assessing medication use is essential when interpreting bloodwork results.
