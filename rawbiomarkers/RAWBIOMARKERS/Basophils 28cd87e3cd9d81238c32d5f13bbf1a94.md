# Basophils

Basophils are a type of white blood cell that make up a very small percentage of our white blood cells. ***These are cells that contain histamine and heparin*** (a compound that helps prevent clotting)***, and are associated with inflammation.*** When basophils are in the tissue (not blood) these are referred to as 'mast cells'.

### Optimal values

0.0 x10e3/ul
(Note: some labs have a higher sensitivity for reporting basophils, while most will round up or down (e.g. either 0.0 OR 0.1), select labs will provide a specific result (e.g. 0.06). Anything up to around 0.09 appears to be optimal).

### Low Basophils

*Not usually a concern*

- Pregnancy
- Hyperthyroidism
- Corticosteroid medications

### High Basophils

- Allergies
- Inflammation
- Intestinal permeability
- Thyroid hypofunction
- Parasitic infections
- Chronic hemolytic anemia
- Influenza

### What next?

- High basophils + high eosinophils + high monocytes + low neutrophils + high ALP + high or low globulin + low iron ***may be seen in parasitic infections.***
- High basophils + high CRP + high ESR + high fibrinogen + high LDH + high ferritin + high iron + high or low globulin + high potassium ***may be seen in inflammation.***
