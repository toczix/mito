# Diagonal ear lobe crease and heart disease

![Untitled](Diagonal%20ear%20lobe%20crease%20and%20heart%20disease/Untitled.png)

Diagonal ear lobe crease (DELC or Frank's Sign) is a diagonal crease visible on the ear (as seen in the picture). 

For almost 50 years practitioners have observed correlations between this sign and heart disease. In recent years a link has been established in scientific research, with the hypothesis that impaired oxygen saturation leads to the development of the crease. 

***For practitioners working 'in-person' this can be a useful visual cue to add to your signs and symptoms toolbox.***
