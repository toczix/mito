# Iron deficiency and hypothyroidism

A recent systematic review and meta analysis assessed the correlation between iron status and thyroid function (1). Majority of participants in the studies were women who were either pregnant or of childbearing age. Interestingly, low iron status was associated not only with reduced FT3 and FT4, but also correlated with reduced [TSH](TSH%20(Thyroid%20Stimulating%20Hormone)%2028cd87e3cd9d8100be26f8bbe331cf27.md) (especially in pregnant women). Surprisingly there was also an association with low iron status and increased [TPO](TPO%20(Thyroid%20Peroxidase)%20Antibodies%2028cd87e3cd9d8103b545ceed4d66d0de.md) and thyroglobulin antibodies. This is especially interesting as it suggests that low iron stores and inefficient enzymatic activity could lead to an immune response stimulating higher antibody levels. 

### Bottom line

Assessing iron status in clients with impaired thyroid function is important, and correcting iron status may lead to better outcomes than are achieved with thyroid medication alone (2).
