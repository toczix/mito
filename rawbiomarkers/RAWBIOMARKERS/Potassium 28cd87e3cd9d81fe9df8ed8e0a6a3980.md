# Potassium

Potassium is one of the main electrolytes in the body and works together with sodium to regulate a cellular pump / transportation process. Around 95% of our potassium is within cells, so even a small change in serum potassium can be significant.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal values

4.0-4.5mmol/L

### Low potassium

- Adrenal stress / high aldosterone
- Fluid loss (e.g vomiting, diarrhea, excess sweating)
- High insulin
- Low magnesium

### High potassium

- Dehydration / impaired kidney function
- Acute increase in potassium intake
- Low aldosterone
- Cell damage (e.g. excess exercise)

### What next

→ Low potassium + high sodium ***may suggest adrenal stress / elevated aldosterone.***
→ Low potassium + low sodium ***may suggest excess fluid loss.***

→ High / normal potassium + low sodium + low / normal glucose ***may suggest adrenal insufficiency.***
