# Serum Iron

Serum iron measures the iron that is bound to serum proteins (mainly transferrin). Generally around 1/3 of transferrin is saturated with iron, so this reflects 1/3 of the total iron binding capacity (TIBC) of transferrin. Around 70% of the iron in the body is in the form of hemoglobin, and therefore Red Blood Cell markers and the rest of an iron panel must be assessed together as serum iron in isolation is a poor indicator of iron status.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal values

14.3-23.2umol/L or 80-130mcg/dL

### Low Serum Iron

- Infection / inflammation
- Blood loss (e.g internal bleeding, menses)
- Liver dysfunction
- Iron deficiency
- Hypochlorhydria

### High Serum Iron

- Hemochromatosis
- Vitamin B6 deficiency
- Infection / parasitic infection
- Thalassemia
- Hemolytic anemia

### What next?

→ Assess the rest of the iron panel (Transferrin, TIBC, Ferritin)

→ If high: Assess if [AST](AST%2028cd87e3cd9d81c8bbc3f8bda54a6dda.md) and [ALT](ALT%2028cd87e3cd9d81449987e6a2792ab4b6.md) are low if suspecting B6 deficiency

→ If high: Assess for hemochromatosis

→ If low: Assess if [AST](AST%2028cd87e3cd9d81c8bbc3f8bda54a6dda.md) and [ALT](ALT%2028cd87e3cd9d81449987e6a2792ab4b6.md) are high if suspecting liver dysfunction
→ If low: Assess for high [MCV](MCV%20(with%20video!)%2028cd87e3cd9d815b9075c485161b6160.md) and [MCH](MCH%2028cd87e3cd9d813b95efeae21f4e39f2.md) and low [ALP](ALP%2028cd87e3cd9d8138865ae5f324dfbb91.md), Chloride, and Gastrin if suspecting hypochlorhydria
