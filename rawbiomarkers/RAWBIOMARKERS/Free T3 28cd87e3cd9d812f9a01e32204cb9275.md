# Free T3

FT3, or Free T3, is the most active form of thyroid hormone, with about 80% produced in peripheral cells (and 20% produced in the thyroid). FT3 measures the unbound levels of T3 in the blood; while this is only a very small amount of the total T3 level, it is a more accurate measure. Majority of the active thyroid hormone (T3) is obtained through converting T4 into T3 using what are known as Deiodinase 1 and 2 enzymes. Abnormal FT3 levels can indicate an overactive or underactive thyroid (hyper or hypothyroidism).
