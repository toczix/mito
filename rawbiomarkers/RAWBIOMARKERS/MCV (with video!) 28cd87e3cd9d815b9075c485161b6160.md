# MCV (with video!)

**MEAN CORPUSCULAR VOLUME**

MCV is a blood marker in the ‘full blood count’ panel (where the red / white blood cells are listed), it measures the average volume of your red blood cells and can tell us whether red blood cells are small, normal, or large (therefore it is a helpful anemia marker). 

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal Values

82-89fL

### Low MCV

- Anemia (caused by low iron, B6, blood loss, heavy metal toxicity, parasites, or a genetic disorder - Thalassemia)

### High MCV

- Anemia (caused by low B12 or B9, low stomach acid, heavy metals, and bacterial overgrowth are also associated)
- Hypothyoridism

### What next?

If MCV is low or high, correlate to other nutrient markers. 

- Low MCV + low ALT, low AST, high Homocysteine could suggest B6 deficiency
- Low MCV + low RBC, low Hemoglobin, lor Iron, low Ferritin, low Transferrin Saturation, high RDW could suggest iron deficiency
- High MCV + high MCH, high MCHC, high LDH, high RWD, low Serum B12, low Serum Folate could suggest B12 / B9 deficiency

### VIDEO

I've had a few requests for videos for other markers, so here is a video for the next marker, MCV. This can help contextualise the markers a bit more and start to tie together how they can contribute to the larger picture.
