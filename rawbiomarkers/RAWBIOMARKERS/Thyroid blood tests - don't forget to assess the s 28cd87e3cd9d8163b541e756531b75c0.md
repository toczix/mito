# Thyroid blood tests - don't forget to assess the season!

In the Notion database I provide what are more 'optimal' blood values based on health outcomes. Even when using these ranges though, it is essential to remember that individual variance occurs, and blood test results often ebb and flow over hormonal cycles, daily patterns, and seasonal changes. This is really important when we are tracking markers over time, sometimes a bit of a shift up or down in a test result is not indicative of an underlying dysfunction but a natural change.

**Thyroid markers are an important example of this.**

In a 2022 study thyroid blood markers were assessed in over 7,000 healthy subjects (1). What the researchers discovered is that TSH levels were 1.61 (highest median month) in winter, but dropped all the way down to 1.16 in the lowest median month in summer. While FT4 stayed relatively consistent, FT3 was significantly affected by season too, with the median score being as low as 2.97pg/ml in winter and as high as 3.39pg/ml in summer. This is especially interesting as that means that the median score in the lowest month in winter was actually lower than what I would regard as the lowest end of the optimal range (3.0pg/ml).

### Bottom line

We must understand some natural variation occurs in blood markers. A good example is thyroid function which can see a significant increase in TSH and lowering in FT3 in winter and reductions in TSH and increases in FT3 in summer.
