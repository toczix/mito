# Celiac Disease and Hemochromatosis

A pattern I have seen in clients I work with is an increased risk of hemochromatosis (or iron overload) in people with celiac disease. This is somewhat counterintuitive as celiac disease is also commonly associated with iron deficiency due to malabsorption, chronic inflammation, and sometimes even gastrointestinal bleeding. 

When we look at the available literature though, we see that there may well be an increased risk between the two hereditary conditions. According to a 2014 study in 29,096 people with celiac disease and 144,522 controls, researchers found that celiac disease was associated with a more than 2 fold greater risk of hemochromatosis (1). This may in part be explained by one of the implicated celiac disease genes (DQ2) being situated closely to the hemochromatosis gene (HFE), and therefore there may be an increased genetic susceptibility to both of these conditions. 

### Bottom Line

While low iron is also common in people with Celiac Disease (and may even be helpful as a predictive tool), indications of iron overload are surprisingly common. In these cases hemochromatosis testing should be performed, and excess iron levels addressed (see iron overload / hemochromatosis protocol for more information)
