# Ferritin

Ferritin is a storage protein for iron in the body and can be used as a more accurate indication of iron status than a serum iron test alone. While a ferritin test measures serum ferritin, this is likely to closely correlate to tissue ferritin levels. Ferritin levels are known to increase in the presence of inflammation or infection and this may not be representative of stored iron levels in these instances.

### Optimal values

50-150ug/L or 50-150ng/ml

<aside>
👋 Note: Personally, I want to see anyone who has a history of iron deficiency to aim for ferritin levels >50, however in the absence of any other iron deficiency patterns or history then ferritin levels between 30-50 may not be indicative of iron deficiency.

</aside>

### Low Ferritin

- Low iron intake / iron deficiency
- Blood loss (e.g internal bleeding, menses)
- Hypochlorhydria / malabsorption
- Chronic infection

### High Ferritin

- Hemochromatosis
- Inflammation
- Liver damage / fatty liver
- Anemia of chronic disease
- B6 deficiency

### What next?

→ Assess the rest of the iron panel (Iron, Transferrin, TIBC)

→ **If low:** Assess for high [MCV](MCV%20(with%20video!)%2028cd87e3cd9d815b9075c485161b6160.md) and [MCH](MCH%2028cd87e3cd9d813b95efeae21f4e39f2.md) and low [ALP](ALP%2028cd87e3cd9d8138865ae5f324dfbb91.md), [Chloride](Chloride%2028cd87e3cd9d8110932af66495009441.md), and Gastrin if suspecting hypochlorhydria
→ **If low:** Assess [hemoglobin](Hemoglobin%20(with%20video!)%2028cd87e3cd9d8112ad1ed7d868516612.md), [serum iron](Serum%20Iron%2028cd87e3cd9d81eda133f40b8bf7c556.md), and transferrin saturation (low) and transferrin / TIBC (high) if suspecting iron deficiency

→ **If high:** Assess if [AST](AST%2028cd87e3cd9d81c8bbc3f8bda54a6dda.md) and [ALT](ALT%2028cd87e3cd9d81449987e6a2792ab4b6.md) are low if suspecting B6 deficiency

→ **If high:** Assess for hemochromatosis

→ **If high:** Assess for liver burden or fatty liver
