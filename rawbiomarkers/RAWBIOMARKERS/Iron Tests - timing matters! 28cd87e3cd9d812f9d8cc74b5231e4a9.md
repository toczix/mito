# Iron Tests - timing matters!

I've covered this in the past, but it's actually a mistake I see almost daily in clients, mentoring case studies, and from doctors, so I really want to simplify this and drive this important point home!

**Iron levels change depending on duration of fasting.**

This is a really helpful visual, basically they assessed the data from over 270,000 iron tests and plotted out the results. What you can see above is the percentage of ABNORMAL iron test results correlated to how long that person was fasted for.

The grey bars are abnormally low iron results and the black bars are abnormally high iron results. The top graph is males and the bottom is females.

As you can see, when fasting for less than 10 hours it was significantly more likely that abnormal results would be low, but when fasting for more than 11 hours it was significantly more likely that abnormal results would be high.

The study concluded at least 5 hours of fasting was needed for iron levels to return to baseline, and that 5-9 hours may be best, however a fasting period of longer than 12 hours should be interpreted cautiously.

***I personally suggest around 10 hours if possible, but I am always wary of high iron readings if someone has fasted for over 12 hours.***

### Bottom line

This is REALLY important. If you or a client has high serum iron (and high transferrin saturation), always begin by checking the time the test was taken and when the last meal was likely to have been consumed. If greater than 12 hours, these test results are very possibly inaccurate.
