# Does Creatine caused elevated Creatinine?

If there's one blood marker that gets confused for something else more often than any other, it is creatinine.

Creatinine is not the same thing as creatine, however you would be forgiven for confusing the two. [Creatinine](Creatinine%2028cd87e3cd9d8119b6dbc99acd182521.md) is a blood marker, and it is a byproduct of muscle creatine breakdown during exercise. Creatine however is a compound made by the body and found in foods (meat) and supplements.

So does taking creatine cause an elevation in blood creatinine levels, and is that dangerous?

Luckily quite a lot of research has gone into this. Studies in resistance trained participants following high protein diets, in athletes, and in postmenopausal women have shown that creatine supplementation has almost no impact on creatinine levels (1,2,3). Some studies suggest that acute loading of very high doses for a few days could have a minimal impact on creatinine levels, but even this is very minor (4). In 2019 a systematic review and meta analysis covered this topic further and found that the included studies found no significant differences in creatinine levels in those taking creatine or those taking placebo, however there were some reported case studies that suggested some individuals had experienced impaired renal function after using creatine(5). These were confined to individual case studies however, and study findings suggest that creatine is safe and does not cause impaired renal function, even with long term use.

### Bottom line

According to research performed in various populations and demographics, creatine supplementation does not appear to have a significant impact on creatinine levels in a blood test.
