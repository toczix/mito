# Identifying Cell Damage

This is an important pattern that rarely gets discussed, however can be seen relatively frequently. Tissue is basically a group of similar cells, these can form different types of tissue such as muscle tissue, connective tissue, or endothelial tissue. When damage to tissue occurs, we are damaging the cells that make up this tissue (many things can cause cell damage including injury, excess exercise, infection, inflammation, medications, and medical conditions). When the cell is damaged the internal contents of the cell can leach out into the bloodstream, some of these things inside the cells can be measured in bloodwork (such as potassium). Therefore, an elevation in potassium may signal cell damage (this is often overlooked, as many people assume potassium can only be elevated due to dehydration, excess intake, or kidney dysfunction).

### Cell Damage Pattern

In addition to potassium, the enzyme LDH is found in most cells within the body and is therefore generally elevated alongside tissue / cell damage. As white blood cells are involved in the immune and clean up response to inflammation and damage, Neutrophils or Monocytes may also be elevated. Further markers can help identify where the damage is occurring (e.g. Creatine Kinase or AST and ALT)

***Suspect the possibility of cell damage if:***

→ [Potassium](Potassium%2028cd87e3cd9d81fe9df8ed8e0a6a3980.md) is elevated (>4.5mmol/L)
→ [LDH](LDH%20(Lactate%20dehydrogenase)%2028cd87e3cd9d81f49891dbdbc949d775.md) is elevated (>200IU/L)
→ ESR is elevated (>5mm/h)
→ [Neutrophils](Neutrophils%2028cd87e3cd9d813a95b0f501798e95f7.md) may be elevated (>4.5)
→ [Monocytes](Monocytes%2028cd87e3cd9d81f09f99c50752c1dd25.md) may be elevated (>0.5)
