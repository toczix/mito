# Homocysteine

Homocysteine is an an intermediary compound in the conversion of methionine into cysteine (which is a precursor for glutathione). Elevated levels of homocysteine have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, however some of this research appears to have a publication bias. 

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

The conversion process for homocysteine involves vitamin B6, B12, and B9, therefore deficiencies in these nutrients could lead to an elevation in homocysteine. It's important to note that homocysteine also increases with fat free mass, so it can be normal for those who resistance train to have higher levels. Furthermore, homocysteine can change by about 10% from day to day, so interpretation should account for this.

### Optimal values

6-10umol/L

### Low Homocysteine

- Glutathione need
- Low protein intake
- Pregnancy
- Insulin resistance
- Oxidative stress
- Hyperthyroidism
- Excessive folate supplementation

### High Homocysteine

- B12/B6/B9 deficiency
- Vitamin C deficiency
- MTHFR gene mutation
- Smoking
- Hypothyroidism
- High muscle mass
- Cardiovascular disease / stroke risk

### What next?

→ If Homocysteine is low assess nutrient intake of sulfur based compounds (e.g. meat) and for signs of oxidative stress (e.g. high or low GGT, high uric acid, high bilirubin).
→ If Homocysteine is high then assess metabolic markers (e.g. glucose, insulin, HBA1C, Cholesterol, Triglycerides) and B vitamin status (e.g. MCV, serum folate and serum B12).
