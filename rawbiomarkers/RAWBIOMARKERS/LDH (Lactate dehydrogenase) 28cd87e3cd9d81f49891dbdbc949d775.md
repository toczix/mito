# LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase)

LDH is a group of enzymes found in muscle, organs, and red blood cells. Because LDH is found in all cells, it is very difficult to ascertain which cells are being broken down when it is elevated. LDH isoenzymes can be measured which will help differentiate which cells are breaking down. LDH is also involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and therefore a low LDH has been associated with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal values

140-200IU/L

### Low LDH

- Hypoglyecmia (low blood sugar)
- Ketogenic diet
- Insulin resistance

### High LDH

- Tissue / bone damage
- Inflammation / infection
- Hypothyroid
- Liver damage
- Anemia

### What next?

***→*** ***If LDH is low*** assess for evidence of blood sugar dysregulation (e.g. test fasting glucose and fasting insulin and assess for symptoms).

***→ If LDH is high*** assess other liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT) to ascertain where the damage may be occurring. Consider running an isoenzymes test.
