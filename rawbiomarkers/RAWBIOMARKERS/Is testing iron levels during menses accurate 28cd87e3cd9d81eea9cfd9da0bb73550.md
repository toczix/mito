# Is testing iron levels during menses accurate?

The average iron loss during menses is around 14mg; this can be significant given that only 1mg per day is usually eliminated (1,2). While research is mixed as to the affect on overall iron stores in some population groups, studies suggest that heavier periods are a significant cause of iron deficiency anemia (3,4,5,6).

### So could testing iron stores during menses cause an inaccurate result?

Once again, the research is a little mixed. When we consider serum Ferritin (a proxy of stored iron), studies generally show that this is not affected by menses or menstrual cycle phase (7,8,9). Conversely, more transient markers like serum iron and transferrin saturation do appear to be altered, however the findings are also somewhat inconsistent (8,10,11,12). We should note that serum iron and transferrin saturation are less reliable markers by themselves anyway as they are heavily affected by other factors such as fasting duration / time of the blood draw.

### Bottom Line

I suspect that part of the reason for the inconsistent findings is to do with individual variability around heaviness of bleeding, baseline iron levels, and testing conditions (e.g. consistency with timing, fasting, etc). Based on what we have available, I believe it is most likely that ferritin is mostly unchanged by phase of the menstrual cycle and is relatively accurate when assessed during menses, but that other iron markers may be inconsistent or inaccurate and should be tested at a different point of the menstrual cycle (e.g. luteal phase).
