# Anemia of iron deficiency vs Anemia of chronic disease

## Iron deficiency anemia

This is caused by a lack of iron (usually due to low dietary intake), however may also be associated with blood loss.

## Anemia of chronic disease

This is caused by a range of chronic diseases, infections, and inflammatory conditions that dysregulates iron absorption and utilisation. The main difference in bloodwork is TIBC levels tend not to be increased and Ferritin may be higher.

### Bloodwork Pattern:

Serum Iron: Normal or low (<23.2umol/L or 130mcg/dL)
Ferritin: Low (<50ug/L or 50ng/ml)
TIBC: High (>62umol/L or 350mg/dL)
Transferrin Saturation: Low (<25%)

### Bloodwork Pattern:

Serum Iron: Low (<14.3umol/L or 80mcg/dL)
Ferritin: High, normal, or low
TIBC: Normal or Low (<62umol/L or 350mg/dL)
Transferrin Saturation: Low (<25%)
