# ALT

ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) is a liver enzyme found predominantly in the liver (however also in skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney). ALT has a half life of around 47 hours, and when it is elevated it is typically associated with liver damage. ALT is involved in metabolism and is B6 dependant, so when it is decreased it can be a sign of low B6 status.

### Optimal values

13-23IU/L (male)
9-19IU/L (female)

### Low ALT

→ Low B6

### High ALT

→ Liver damage
→ Infection (e.g. viral)
→ Fatty liver
→ Excessive muscle breakdown
→ Biliary issues
→ Pancreatitis

💡

*ALT should always be assessed against other liver enzymes.*

**→** If **ALT is low** + AST is low, ***consider B6 deficiency.***

**→** If **ALT** and AST are **slightly elevated** + elevated GGT + elevated Triglycerides ***consider fatty liver.***
