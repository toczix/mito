# Fasting Insulin

Insulin is released in response to rising blood glucose, helping reduce blood glucose levels by enabling cells to take in glucose. The relationship with insulin, glucagon, and glucose is complex, and the accuracy of using fasting insulin to assess glucose control is questionable. When someone becomes less sensitive to the action of insulin this is commonly referred to as 'insulin resistance', and may lead to elevated blood insulin and blood glucose levels. Unfortunately glucagon is generally not tested, but assessing glucagon, glucose, and insulin together provides more insight.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal values

13-40pmol/L OR 2-6mg/dl

### Low Fasting Insulin

- Type 1 Diabetes
- Pituitary insufficiency
- GABA deficiency
- Low GLP 1

### High Fasting Insulin

- Insulin resistance
- Fatty liver
- Pancreatic growths
- Obesity
- Medications
- Pregnancy
- Dysbiosis / LPS

### What next?

→ If **fasting insulin is high** + fasting glucose is high ***suspect insulin resistance.***
→ If **fasting insulin is high** + fasting glucose is high + triglycerides are high + GGT is high, ***suspect metabolic dysfunction / fatty liver.***
→ If blood sugar control issues are suspected, using a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) for two weeks may provide further insight into blood sugar trends.
