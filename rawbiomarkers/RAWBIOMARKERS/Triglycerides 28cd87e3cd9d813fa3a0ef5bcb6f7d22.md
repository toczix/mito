# Triglycerides

Triglycerides are fatty acids that are derived from dietary intake (fats) or created by the liver. Triglycerides are the primary storage form of fatty acids in the body, and are heavily influenced by dietary fat consumption (so they must be tested in a fasted state). Elevated triglycerides are strongly associated with metabolic issues, fatty liver, and insulin resistance, and low triglycerides appear to have a significant association with various forms of autoimmunity.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

### Optimal values

0.6-1.0mmol/L or 53-88.5mg/dL

### Low Triglycerides

- Autoimmunity / chronic inflammation
- Low fat intake / vegetarian diet
- Poor fat absorption

### High Triglycerides

- Insulin resistance
- Fatty liver
- Hypothyroidism
- Excessive alcohol intake
- Anorexia
- Poor utilisation of fats

### **What next?**

→ If triglycerides are low, then assess white blood cells (may be high or low) and high ESR for signs of chronic inflammation

→ If triglycerides are elevated + high GGT, then assess for Fatty Liver (please see 'calculating fatty liver risk' post)
