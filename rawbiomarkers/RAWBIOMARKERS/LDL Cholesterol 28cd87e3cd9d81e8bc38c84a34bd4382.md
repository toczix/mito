# LDL Cholesterol

Cholesterol is an essential constituent of cell membranes and a precursor for steroidal hormones and bile acids. Cholesterol is found in every cell in the body, as well as the plasma, and is mostly made in the liver (however some is made in other organs and some is sourced from diet). 

[Total Cholesterol](Total%20Cholesterol%2028cd87e3cd9d811fb138cc5bfa8fbac9.md) is calculated by adding LDL Cholesterol, [HDL Cholesterol](HDL%20Cholesterol%2028cd87e3cd9d81929c8af2cccb6b21fa.md), and 20% of triglyceride levels. These tests do not measure lipoprotein particle number, and as such are poor at identifying cardiovascular risk.

### Optimal values

2.07-4.4mmol/L or 80-170mg/dL
*Note: Women post menopause could safely have levels around 20% higher than this, and younger people (e.g. <34) may have levels a little lower sometimes.*

### Low LDL Cholesterol

- Inflammation / LPS
- Hyperthyroidism
- Low fat intake / fat malabsorption

### High LDL Cholesterol

- Biliary insufficiency / gallbladder dysfunction
- Hypothyroidism
- High Insulin
- Gene variations
- Pregnancy
- Anabolic steroid use

### What next?

→ If **LDL Cholesterol is high or low**, ***assess entire lipid panel*** (HDL Cholesterol, Triglycerides), ***inflammation markers*** (White blood cells, ESR, CRP), ***thyroid markers*** (TSH, FT3, FT4), ***and liver / gallbladder markers*** (bilirubin, AST, ALT, GGT, ALP).
